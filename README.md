# HabitTracker
Habit Tracker | Android app

## Idea:
At the beginning of every year, numerous new year's resolutions are set; however, by the middle of January, all traces of the goal seem to have disappeared. Far too often are goals set and forgotten in a few days. My application proposes a solution to keep its users on track to completing their goals and visualize their progression. This application will prompt to reflect on their progress, log their journey, and build a habit.
